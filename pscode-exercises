Get number via input
Check if number is divisible by 2.
If yes, print "EVEN"
If no, print "ODD"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Get 5 numbers via input
Add all numbers and divide by 5
Put all numbers in a list
Use max and min functions to find largest and smallest numbers
Store max and min as variables
Print "The max is {max variable} and the min is {min variable}"
